# bound_states
Numerically computing bound states. This repository contains the source code for [this paper](http://www.unc.edu/~marzuola/MastersProject_MatthewHarris_Spring2013.pdf) and for any future research relating to computing bound states using the algorithm outlined in the paper.

## Note
From Jeremy Marzuola: techniques are all correct and applicable, but the geometric potential in H^2 takes an attractive character in the simulations and it should take a repulsive character. This should suggest interesting calculations in higher dimensional H^{n+1} spaces.
